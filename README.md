# Website-User-Conversion-Rate
An academic Project in Marketing Analytics to check the probability of user conversion of a website using logistic regression

Monitoring the online metrics is an important thing when you are in the process of building the business, under such circumstances, one of the parameters to be monitored is website user conversion. The main question encountered is what is website user conversion?
The phrase "website user conversion" refers to the process by which users who browse and look at different items on a website are led to do an activity that has been predetermined and is wanted by the website's owners. In light of the e-commerce dataset, which is being investigated in more depth by us, the primary objective of this research is to calculate the lift metric ratio for a made-up scenario. The issue that has to be answered is, what exactly is the lift metric ratio? To put it in plain terms, the formula is as follows: the goal response is divided by the average response.

Using various logistic regression models models 1-5, achieving model-5 as best with 84% accuracy calculated the lift metric ratio (Target Response / Average Response) based upon the predicted dataset from the model.

Considering a hypothetical scenario that increases the variable total pages visited by 1 unit and tabulating the predictions in the dataset, we have calculated the lift metric ratio which is around 31.7%.
